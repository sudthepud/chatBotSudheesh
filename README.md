# chatBotSudheesh
ChatBot coded in Python, is able to tell the weather, do simple math, and respond to simple tasks or questions. It relies on the Microsoft bot framework for functionality using app.py and configy.py.

The bot is able to find the weather in user-specified locations by calling an external API, do basic math, and respond to simple questions and tasks.

The bot.py is the file containing the bot's logic coded in python, and relies on the Microsoft bot framework, which provides Microsoft's app.py and config.py files

To run the chatbot, the Microsoft bot framework emulator is required. First, download the files into a directory and download the microsoft bot framework emulator, navigate into the directory, and run python app.py, then go to the emulator, click open bot, then enter http://localhost:3978/api/messages as the bot URL, and then click connect.
